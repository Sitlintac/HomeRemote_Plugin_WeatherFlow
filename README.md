# HomeRemote_Plugin_WeatherFlow
Weather Flow integration for Home Remote; allows read-only access to one weather station (access token required).  The plugin will fetch your weather station's current observations as well as its weather forecast.

## Plugin Settings:
- **Access Token**: Your Personal Access Token, required to access your weather station.  Log in to the Tempest Web App at tempestwx.com, then go to Settings -> Data Authorizations -> Create Token to generate this.
- **StationID**: *[optional]* If you have more than one weather station associated with your account, you can specify the ID of the station you want this plugin to access.
- **Metric Units**: Boolean value.  Default of "true" returns results in metric units; any other value returns results in Imperial units.

## Virtual Devices Created
- **CurrentConditions**: a device of type "WeatherStation" that is populated with your weather station's observations
- **ForecastDay0** to **ForecastDay9**: ten devices of type "ForecastDay" that are populated with your weather station's forecasts for today's weather (ForecastDay0) and the next nine days (ForecastDay1 through ForecastDay9)
- **ForecastHour0** to **ForecastHour23**: twenty-four devices of type "ForecastHour" that are populated with your weather station's detailed forecast for the next 24 hours

For ForecastDay0, which contains today's forecast, hours that have already elapsed are assigned "--" in the Description field and "" in the Icon field.  The **HourlyForecast** array is designed to be displayed in a GridView.
